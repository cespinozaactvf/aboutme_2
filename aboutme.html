		<h2>‚ú®Biography‚ú®</h2>
		<p> Hello, My name is Christian Espinoza and i'm a senior at ACTVF. I was born in <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens">Queens, New York</a> on October 4, 2001. Life at Actvf isn't the best. I don't like being in this school. It feel like i don't belong in here. For my four years in ACTVF, i haven't been doing so well. During 8th grade when we were doing the high school appliction, i really wanted to go to ACTVF because it look like it will be a good school, but i was wrong. And now I'm a senior and i'm not sure if i should be exicted about going to college. I'm worried that i might end up in a college that i don't want to be in. My professional interests is art, i really LOVE drawing and making art. I'm may be shy showing off my art work but i still enjoy doing art. I hope that learing art can make my future better, for now let see if i graduate high school. </p>

		<p>Well, my hobbies are drawing, watching anime, listening to music and relaxing. I have been drawing ever since when i was in middle school. i usually draw flowers or nature because it's easy to draw. Also, when i'm in class, i usually draw on my work when i feel bored. I have a major interest in Art. I love to watch anime. My favorite anime is My Hero Academia. I have a nice family. I have my parents, a older brother and a younger sister. I have a pet goldfish and i usually the one that feed him. I like to listen to music. My favorite music genre is pop music. I also like music that have a catchy beat, no matter what genre it is. I like relaxing, it make me feel so relaxed of course, but i usually so tired when i come back from school. No wonder why i usually wake up late and be late to school. </p>

		<h2>‚ú®Technology‚ú®</h2>
		<p>I enjoy using technology like my phone and my computer. I like using my phone more then my computer because it's easier to use. I do my homework in my computer. When my computer or my phone isn't working that well, i usually know how to fix it. When my mom need help with her phone, she always ask me for help, and i always fix it. i don't know if i should go to a tech school because i'm pretty good at it but that is not what i want to learn, i rather learn art then technology.</p>
